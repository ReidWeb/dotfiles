# ReidWeb does dotfiles 
This is my collection of dotfiles, I'm storing them in the open on GitHub so I can always access them when I need them. But you may also find them useful, feel free to fork the repository or use the files as you see fit.

## Organisation
The files are sorted relative to your home directory, ideally you should clone the repo into a temporary directory and copy the files into place.
